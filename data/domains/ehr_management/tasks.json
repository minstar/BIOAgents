TIMI 3 flow restored (complete perfusion). Door-to-balloon time: 68 minutes. Guideline target is <90 minutes — this was MET. Faster reperfusion = more myocardium saved.\n\n2. ECHO FINDINGS: LVEF 40% (reduced; normal >55%). Anterior wall hypokinesis = damaged myocardium from LAD occlusion. No MR (mitral regurgitation) or pericardial effusion — good prognostic signs. LVEF 40% = moderate dysfunction. May improve over weeks-months with GDMT (ventricular remodeling).\n\n3. TROPONIN PEAK: 45.2 ng/mL — indicates large infarct size. CK-MB peaked at 156 — correlates with moderate-large infarct.\n\n4. PROGNOSIS: GRACE score 142 (intermediate risk, 6-month mortality 3-8%). With timely PCI, appropriate GDMT, and cardiac rehab, prognosis is favorable. Repeat echo in 3 months to reassess LVEF — if no improvement, consider ICD.",
