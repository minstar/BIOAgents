He notes that this is particularly obvious when he is mowing his lawn or climbing the stairs in his home. His past medical history is significant for hypertension that is well-controlled with lisinopril. His vital signs are as follows: T 37.6 C, HR 88, BP 136/58, RR 18, SpO2 97% RA. Physical examination is significant for an early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border, a midsystolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, and a late diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex on auscultation. In addition, an S3 heart sound is also present. Bounding pulses are palpated at the radial arteries bilaterally. Which of the following diagnoses is most likely in this patient?",

The patient reports no new symptoms except for shortness of breath and fatigue during exercise that began 3 months ago when he tried to increase the distance of his daily walk from 1 mile to 3 miles. He has not had orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest pain. Additional medical history is significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, and polymyalgia rheumatica.

Medications are metoprolol, atorvastatin, lisinopril, omeprazole, and a low dose of prednisone every other day. The patient is active and manages a small farm. BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse 60/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 124/61 mm Hg.

She has been visiting the same dentist since childhood and for the past 2 years has had at least 2 visits for dental caries. She eventually admitted to him that she regularly induces vomiting by putting her fingers down her throat. She says she has been doing this for the last few years and purging at least once a week. More recently, she has been inducing emesis more often and even looked into diuretics as she feels that she is gaining more and more weight compared to her ‘skinny friends’. Her BMI is at the 50th percentile for her age and sex.

She also notes having occasional palpitations, nervousness, sweating, and heat intolerance. Her past medical history is unremarkable. She reports a 20-pack-year smoking history and is currently a daily smoker. Physical examination shows an anxious, trembling woman. She has eyelid retraction bilaterally, with an inability to fully close her eyes. Her extraocular motility is limited on upgaze. There is no thyromegaly, and no thyroid nodules are noted. Laboratory studies reveal a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.1 μU/mL and total T4 of 42 μg/dL. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin is positive. CT scan of the orbits shows proptosis and marked enlargement of the extraocular muscle with sparing of the tendons. Which of the following would most likely transiently worsen this patient’s eye symptoms?\n\nOption A: External orbital radiation\nOption B: Selenium supplementation\nOption C: Systemic corticosteroids\nOption D: Treatment with radioactive iodine",
